# How to earn credits?

You can earn credits in different ways!

* `?daily` (?d) you can earn 400 credits every 24 hours.
* `?loot` (?l) you can earn random credits and random items every 10 minutes.
* `?job` you choose a jop by typing a number between 1 & 10. Then you wait until the job has been completed and as a reward you will receive a random amount of credits. (Profi tip: The longer the job, the more credits you get.)
* You can also earn between 100-1000 credits by clicking on the [Vote](https://discordbots.org/bot/354712333853130752/vote) button and vote for the bot. (In the weekend you receive between 200 and 2000 credits for upvoting the bot)
* You can earn 100 credits by reporting a bug on the [LenoxBot Discord server](https://lenoxbot.com/discord/).
* You can earn 100 credits by writing a suggestion on the [LenoxBot Discord server](https://lenoxbot.com/discord/).
