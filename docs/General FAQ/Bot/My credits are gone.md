# My credits are gone, what can I do?

Rarely it happens that credits just disappear, so we need precise information what you have previously entered as a command to investigate the problem.

That's why we ask you to create a ticket (**?ticket**) on the LenoxBot Discord Server with the following informations:

* Your Discord username 
* Your userID
* When did you have your credits? 
* Which commands did you use before your credits disappear?

In any case, in which the credits have disappeared, we will refund them, so don't worry about that!
